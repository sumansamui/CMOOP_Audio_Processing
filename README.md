# Surrogate-Assisted Memetic Constrained Multi-Objective Optimization for TinyML Audio Classification

This repository contains the code, experimental setup, and supplementary materials for the paper:

**"Memetic Constrained Evolutionary Optimization of Deep Learning Models for Audio Classification on Resource-Constrained Devices"**

Submitted to the **IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation** (Special Issue on Recent Trends in Evolutionary Constrained Optimization).

## üìù Overview

The goal of this project is to optimize deep neural network architectures for audio classification tasks such as **Keyword Spotting (KWS)** and **Bird Call Identification** on **TinyML devices**, under multiple conflicting objectives and constraints, including:

- **Accuracy** (maximize)
- **Model size** (minimize)
- **False Positive Rate (FPR)** (minimize)
- **Hardware feasibility** constraints (e.g., memory)

We propose a **Surrogate-Assisted NSGA-II (SA-NSGA-II)** framework with:

- Gaussian Process (Kriging) based surrogate modeling
- Constraint-aware scoring and filtering
- Lamarckian surrogate-guided local search
- Variance-based uncertainty sampling
- Smart population initialization via multi-stage CMOO

## üìä Datasets

We used the following publicly available datasets:

- **[Google Speech Commands v2 (GSC)](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/speech_commands)**  
  For training and evaluating keyword spotting models on TinyML hardware.

- **[BirdCLEF 2021](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/birdclef-2021)**  
  For bird species classification from real-world environmental recordings.



## üöÄ Key Features of This Repository

- ‚úÖ **Constraint-Aware Surrogate Scoring**  
  Penalty-based scalarization of predicted objective and constraint violations.

- üß† **Surrogate-Guided Lamarckian Local Search**  
  Local refinement using surrogate landscapes to improve exploitation.

- üìà **Variance-Based Exploration**  
  High-uncertainty samples are selectively evaluated to improve surrogate fidelity.

- ‚ôüÔ∏è **Sub-Problem Decomposition-Based Initialization**  
  High-quality initial population generation by solving bi-objective CMOO sub-problems.

- üìê **Comprehensive Evaluation Metrics**  
  Uses **Hypervolume (HV)**, **Inverted Generational Distance (IGD)**, and **Spread** to assess solution quality and diversity.
